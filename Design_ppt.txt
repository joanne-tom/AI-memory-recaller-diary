Episodic memory in ai agents poses risks that should be studied and mitigated
Chad DeChant, Computer Science Department
Columbia University, New York, NY, 10027, USA, 20 Jan 2025

Insight: The paper highlights the potential of episodic memory in enhancing AI agents by enabling them to store and retrieve past experiences, improving 
personalization, adaptability, and long-term learning. 
Drawback: Episodic memory involves storing detailed and sensitive user data, which poses risks of data breaches, misuse, or unauthorized access.


AI and memory
Andrew Hoskins, Interdisciplinary Research Professor
University of Glasgow, United Kingdom, Sep 2024

Insight: It discusses how memory allows AI models to continuously update and store information over time, thus improving their ability to adapt to new 
situations and enhance decision-making.
Drawback: AI systems struggle to retrieve memories relevant to the specific context, leading to irrelevant or inappropriate responses.


MemoryBank: Enhancing Large Language Models with Long-Term Memory

University of Southern California, United States, 21 May, 2023

Insight: The paper introduces a "memory bank" that enables models to effectively manage and organize past interactions, allowing them to improve knowledge 
retrieval and maintain context across different tasks without being limited by short-term memory.
Drawback: Episodic memory systems lack emotional intelligence to interact with users in a meaningful and empathetic way.


The Impact of Digital Technology, Social Media, and Artificial Intelligence on Cognitive Functions
Mathura Shanmugasundaram, Arunkumar Tamilarasu
Independent Researchers, United States, 24 Nov, 2023

Insight: It highlights both the positive and negative effects of technology on cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and critical thinking.
Drawback: Reduced mental stimulation from external reliance - Using AI tools too frequently might result in diminished brain activity as users rely on 
external help for tasks they could solve on their own.



Aims
1. The interactive features of your AI recaller—such as emotion-based suggestions and memory-based conversations—can stimulate users to think about their 
past experiences, promoting mental stimulation and better memory recall.
2. We will ensure that user passwords are not stored in plain text. By using password hashing techniques like bcrypt or Argon2, we will securely store 
passwords, providing an extra layer of protection in the event of a data breach.
3. Integrate advanced contextual understanding using transformers , enabling the system to recall contextually appropriate memories.
4. Employ emotion detection and classification to adapt responses based on the user’s emotional state, enhancing user experience and trust.


Design
AI-powered memory recall diary begins with a User Login Page for secure access. The Main Page features three 
key sections: a large left box for diary entries, where users can write and save their thoughts; a medium right box for keyword-based searches that retrieve 
related diary entries in chronological order; and a top-right panel labeled "My Account" for profile management. At the top-left corner, a small typing bar 
displays the prompt, "Hey, how do you feel today?" Clicking it opens a chat-like interface where users can share their emotions (e.g., "happy") and receive 
prompts like "Do you want to reminisce all the happy memories?" for emotion-based memory retrieval. The design ensures an intuitive and user-friendly 
experience with easy navigation across features.


Problem Statement
Develop an intuitive tool for individuals to systematically track their emotional well-being, retrieve specific experiences tied to emotions or events and access 
timely mental health support, all while facing concerns about privacy and data security.


Software used
For the AI-powered memory recall diary, the stack includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with React.js for dynamic UI components. 
The backend will use Python (Flask ) for AI features like emotion analysis using NLP libraries such as spaCy/NLTK or Hugging Face's Transformers. 
MongoDB or PostgreSQL handles data storage, along with that AWS S3 handles large data,  and JWT secure user authentication. Hosting can be done via  
AWS for the backend and Netlify or Vercel for the frontend, with MongoDB Atlas for cloud storage and Docker for containerization, ensuring scalable 
deployment. This stack supports a secure, efficient, and user-friendly memory recall diary.
