Workflow for Face Recognition with WebAuthn:
User Registration (Face Scan + Credentials):

Step 1: The user provides a face scan (biometric data), along with their username and password.
Step 2: When the user registers, WebAuthn will create a public-private key pair. The private key is securely stored on the user's device (this could be in the secure enclave, TPM, or the device's trusted security hardware).
Step 3: The public key (along with other necessary metadata like face template data, username, etc.) is sent to the server and stored in the database associated with the username.
Step 4: The face template (which is a biometric representation of the user's face) is securely stored in the database or another storage system alongside the username and password.
User Login (Face Scan + Authentication):

Step 1: The user provides their username and password (optional step, if you want password-based authentication along with face recognition).
Step 2: The system then prompts the user to provide a face scan again.
Step 3: The face scan data is compared with the stored biometric template (either using a third-party service or a face recognition library on the client-side). If it matches, the system proceeds to authenticate the user.
Step 4: If face recognition is successful, the system triggers WebAuthn authentication:
The public key associated with the username is retrieved from the server.
The server generates a challenge (a random string) and sends it to the user's device.
Private Key in Action (Signature Creation):

Step 1: The user's device, which securely stores the private key, uses this private key to sign the challenge generated by the server. The signing operation happens locally on the user's device. The face scan is not directly involved here, but it has already been verified during registration to ensure the biometric data matches the stored template.
Step 2: The signed challenge is sent back to the server.
Server Verifies with Public Key:

Step 1: The server receives the signed challenge and uses the public key (which was stored in the registration step) to verify that the signature matches.
Step 2: If the signature is valid, the server confirms the user's identity and grants access.
